# Jido Dialyzer Type Contract Fix Plan

## Test Setup

This repository contains:
- **0001_local/** - Reproduction project using local Jido dependency for testing fixes
- **jido/** - Local copy of Jido framework where we'll implement the fix
- Both directories are in .gitignore to keep this repo focused on the issue reproduction

## Workflow

1. **Observe Issue**: Run `mix dialyzer` in 0001_local to see the type contract violations
2. **Analyze**: Study `jido/lib/jido/agent.ex` to understand the root cause
3. **Fix**: Implement type contract fix in the local jido directory
4. **Test**: Verify fix by running `mix dialyzer` again in 0001_local

## Expected Issue

The dialyzer errors stem from `jido/lib/jido/agent.ex:592` where the `set/3` function's recursive call passes `opts` (typed as `any()`) to a function expecting `keyword()`.

## Fix Strategy

Add proper type guards or ensure opts is a keyword list before the recursive call to satisfy the type specification.
