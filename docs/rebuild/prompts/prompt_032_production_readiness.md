# Prompt 32: Production Readiness and Deployment Preparation

Continuing Jido-JidoSignal reintegration from Doc 110.

Task: Prepare framework for production deployment (Prompt 32 of ~35)

References needed:
- Doc 108 (Distributed System Considerations)
- Doc 106 (Performance Optimization), section 4
- Doc 101, Week 4, Day 21 (release checklist)

Previous work:
- All features implemented
- Testing comprehensive
- Documentation complete

Implementation requirements:
1. Add production configuration support:
   ```elixir
   # config/prod.exs example
   config :jido,
     pool_size: System.get_env("JIDO_POOL_SIZE", "100"),
     signal_queue_size: 10_000,
     telemetry_sampling_rate: 0.1,
     distributed_mode: true
   ```

2. Implement health checks:
   - Create lib/jido/health.ex
   - Monitor signal queue depths
   - Check agent supervisor health
   - Verify bus connectivity
   - Add HTTP health endpoint support

3. Add operational metrics:
   - Signal dispatch latency
   - Agent execution time
   - Queue depths and throughput
   - Error rates by category
   - Memory usage patterns

4. Create deployment guides:
   - guides/deployment/kubernetes.md
   - guides/deployment/docker.md
   - guides/deployment/clustering.md
   - guides/deployment/monitoring.md

5. Add production safeguards:
   - Rate limiting for signal dispatch
   - Backpressure handling
   - Resource pool management
   - Graceful shutdown procedures
   - Hot code upgrade support

6. Security hardening:
   - Input validation on all APIs
   - Signal source verification
   - Agent permission system
   - Secure distributed communication

Success criteria:
- Production config templates ready
- Health checks comprehensive
- Metrics exported to Telemetry
- Deployment guides tested
- Load testing completed
- Security review passed
