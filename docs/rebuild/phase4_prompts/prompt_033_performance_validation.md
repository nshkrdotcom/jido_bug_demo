# Prompt 33: Final Performance Validation and Benchmarking

Continuing Jido-JidoSignal reintegration from Doc 110.

Task: Validate performance improvements and create benchmarks (Prompt 33 of ~35)

References needed:
- Doc 106 (Performance Optimization), all sections
- Doc 101, Week 3, Day 16-17 (benchmarking)
- Doc 100, section 7 (performance goals - 50% improvement)

Previous work:
- Fast path optimization implemented
- Zero-copy signal passing added
- Object pooling in place
- JIT compilation configured

Implementation requirements:
1. Create comprehensive benchmark suite in bench/:
   ```elixir
   # bench/signal_dispatch_bench.exs
   # bench/agent_execution_bench.exs
   # bench/bus_throughput_bench.exs
   # bench/e2e_latency_bench.exs
   ```

2. Benchmark key operations:
   - Local signal dispatch (fast path)
   - Remote signal dispatch
   - Agent creation/destruction
   - Bus subscription/routing
   - Action execution overhead

3. Compare v1 vs v2 performance:
   - Create comparative benchmarks
   - Measure memory usage reduction
   - Track latency improvements
   - Document throughput gains

4. Load testing scenarios:
   - 10K agents with 100K signals/sec
   - Distributed 5-node cluster test
   - Memory pressure testing
   - Long-running stability test

5. Create performance dashboard:
   - Real-time metrics visualization
   - Historical performance tracking
   - Regression detection
   - Bottleneck identification

6. Document performance characteristics:
   - guides/performance.md
   - Optimization recommendations
   - Capacity planning guide
   - Tuning parameters

Success criteria:
- 50% latency reduction achieved
- Memory usage decreased by 30%
- No performance regressions
- Benchmarks reproducible
- Load tests pass at scale
- Performance guide complete
