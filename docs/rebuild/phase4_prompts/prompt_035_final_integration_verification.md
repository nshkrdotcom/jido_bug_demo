Continuing Jido-JidoSignal reintegration from Doc 110.

Task: Final verification of complete integration (Prompt 35 of ~35)

References needed:
- Doc 100 (Reintegration Approach), all success criteria
- Doc 101, Week 4 success criteria (lines 696-700)

   - [x] Jido.Agent.Instance struct implemented
   - [x] Core.Types module providing type safety
   - [x] All agents use unified Instance type

2. **Signal Integration** (Phase 2 goals):
   - [x] Signal modules moved into jido
   - [x] No more circular dependencies
   - [x] Bus sensor restored and functional
   - [x] Direct agent-signal integration

3. **Performance** (Phase 3 goals):
   - [x] Fast path for local signals
   - [x] Zero-copy optimization
   - [x] 50% latency improvement achieved
   - [x] Memory usage reduced by 30%

4. **Migration & Compatibility** (Phase 4 goals):
