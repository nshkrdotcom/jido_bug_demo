Of course. This is an excellent goal. Keeping the convenience of the macro-based system while hardening it for robustness and static analysis is a great way to improve the framework without losing its developer experience.

The structural analysis is correct, but we can apply its findings to *improve* the code generated by the macros rather than removing them entirely. The goal is to make the generated code Dialyzer-friendly.

Here is a breakdown of how the issues apply to each library, followed by a concrete action plan for your fork.

---

### Framework Breakdown: Issues by Library

#### 1. `jido_action` (`jalib.xml`)

*   **What it is:** The core library for defining individual, reusable `Action`s.
*   **Core Issues Found Here:**
    *   **Runtime Validation (#3):** The `use Jido.Action` macro generates code that uses `NimbleOptions.validate` at runtime to check parameters. This is the primary source of runtime failures instead of compile-time errors for actions.
    *   **Inconsistent Returns (#2):** The `@callback run(...)` expects `{:ok, map()}` or `{:error, any()}`. While consistent within itself, it's part of the broader framework's type inconsistency. The main issue is the `any()` in the error tuple, which is too permissive.

#### 2. `jido_signal` (`relib.xml`)

*   **What it is:** The library for defining and dispatching signals, loosely based on CloudEvents.
*   **Core Issues Found Here:**
    *   **Dynamic Signal Routing (#6):** This is the most significant issue in this library. The use of `Process.info(self(), :current_stacktrace)` to discover the caller at *runtime* is a major red flag for static analysis and performance.
    *   **Opaque State (#5):** The `Jido.Signal` struct itself uses `term()` for its `data` payload, which offers no type safety.

#### 3. `jido` (`r1.xml`)

*   **What it is:** The main framework that brings everything together, defining the `Agent` and the `Server` that runs it.
*   **Core Issues Found Here:**
    *   **Macro-Heavy Architecture (#1):** The `use Jido.Agent` macro is the largest and most complex, generating the entire `Agent` module structure. This is the root of the type confusion.
    *   **Inconsistent Return Types (#2):** The generated `new/2` function returns a bare struct `t()`, while other functions return `{:ok, ...}` tuples.
    *   **Opaque State Management (#5):** The agent's `state` is defined as a `map()`, which provides no type information to Dialyzer.
    *   **Circular Dependencies (#4):** The `Agent` module's generated code calls the `Server`, and the `Server`'s callbacks call back into the `Agent` module. This is a standard OTP pattern, but the macros make it harder for Dialyzer to trace.

### Action Plan: Hardening Jido without Removing Macros

This plan is designed to be incremental. Each phase builds on the last, improving type safety and robustness without requiring a full rewrite.

#### Phase 1: Establish Strong, Consistent Type Contracts

This phase focuses on defining and enforcing consistent types across the framework, which is the most common cause of Dialyzer errors.

**1.1. Create a Central Types Module (or Add to `Error.ex`)**
Create a file like `lib/jido/types.ex` or add to an existing core module to define shared types.

```elixir
# In a new file, e.g., lib/jido/types.ex
defmodule Jido.Types do
  @typedoc "A standardized result tuple for successful operations."
  @type result(t) :: {:ok, t}

  @typedoc "A standardized result tuple for all operations, including errors."
  @type result_with_error(t) :: {:ok, t} | {:error, Jido.Error.t() | atom()}
end
```

**1.2. Standardize Return Types in `Jido.Agent`**
Modify the `__using__` macro in `jido/agent.ex` to generate code with consistent return types.

*   **File to Edit:** `jido/agent.ex`
*   **Change:** Find the `def new(...)` function inside the `quote` block.
*   **Current (Simplified):**
    ```elixir
    def new(id, initial_state) do
      # ... logic
      %__MODULE__{...}
    end
    ```
*   **New (Inside the `quote` block):** Add a typespec and wrap the return in an `:ok` tuple.
    ```elixir
    # Import the new types at the top of the quote block
    import Jido.Types

    @doc "..."
    @spec new(id :: String.t(), initial_state :: map()) :: result_with_error(t())
    def new(id, initial_state) do
      # ... logic
      {:ok, %__MODULE__{...}}
    end
    ```

**1.3. Standardize Action Return Types**
Refine the `run` callback in `jido_action.ex` to use a more specific error type.

*   **File to Edit:** `jido_action.ex`
*   **Change:** Update the `@callback` for `run/2`.
*   **Current:** `@callback run(params :: map(), context :: map()) :: {:ok, map()} | {:error, any()}`
*   **New:**
    ```elixir
    @callback run(params :: map(), context :: map()) ::
                {:ok, map()}
                | {:ok, map(), Directive.t() | [Directive.t()]} # If you support directives
                | {:error, Jido.Action.Error.t() | atom()}
    ```
    This tells developers (and Dialyzer) to return a structured error, not just `any()`.

#### Phase 2: Make State Transparent to Dialyzer

This phase addresses the opaque `state` map in `Jido.Agent`.

**2.1. Generate a `TypedStruct` for Agent State**
Instead of `defstruct`, we will generate a `TypedStruct`. This gives Dialyzer a concrete schema to analyze while keeping the developer experience the same.

*   **File to Edit:** `jido/agent.ex`
*   **Change:** Modify the `__using__` macro.
    1.  Create a helper function *outside* the `quote` block to convert the user's `schema` option into `TypedStruct` fields.
    2.  In the `quote` block, call this helper and generate a `typedstruct` instead of `defstruct`.

*   **New Helper Function (outside `quote`):**
    ```elixir
    defp nimble_to_typed_struct_fields(schema) do
      for {field, opts} <- schema do
        type = nimble_type_to_elixir_type(opts[:type] || :any)
        quote do
          field(unquote(field), unquote(type))
        end
      end
    end

    defp nimble_type_to_elixir_type(type), do: # ... conversion logic ...
    # e.g., :string -> String.t(), :integer -> integer(), etc.
    ```

*   **New Generated Code (inside `quote`):**
    ```elixir
    # ... inside __using__ macro
    use TypedStruct

    # ... get user's schema from validated_opts
    typed_struct_fields = nimble_to_typed_struct_fields(@validated_opts[:schema])

    # In the quote block, generate the typedstruct
    typedstruct module: State do
      # ...
      unquote(typed_struct_fields)
    end

    # Also update the main agent struct to use this new State type
    defstruct state: %State{}, ...
    ```
    This will generate a `YourAgent.State` struct that is strongly typed, and the agent's state will be an instance of it. Dialyzer can now analyze state transitions.

#### Phase 3: Fix Dynamic Signal Dispatch

This addresses the runtime performance and static analysis issue in `jido_signal`.

**3.1. Replace Runtime Stacktrace with Compile-Time `__CALLER__`**
This is a direct, high-impact fix.

*   **File to Edit:** `jido_signal/jido_signal.ex`
*   **Change:** Find the code that uses `Process.info(:current_stacktrace)`. This is likely in a helper function called by the `__using__` macro.
*   **Current (logic):** Get the call stack at runtime to find the caller module.
*   **New (inside `quote`):** Use the `__CALLER__` environment available at compile time.
    ```elixir
    # Inside the __using__ macro in jido_signal.ex
    caller_module = __CALLER__.module

    # ... then inside the `def new(...)` being generated:
    attrs = %{
      "type" => @validated_opts[:type],
      "source" => @validated_opts[:default_source] || to_string(unquote(caller_module)),
      # ... other attributes
    }
    ```
    This change replaces a slow, opaque runtime call with a fast, statically known compile-time value, resolving the issue perfectly while keeping the macro's magic.

#### Phase 4: Add Explicit Implementation Markers

This helps Dialyzer connect the generated code to the defined behaviours.

**4.1. Generate `@impl` for Callbacks**
In the macros, wherever you `def` a function that is part of a `@behaviour`, add `@impl` right before it.

*   **Files to Edit:** `jido/agent.ex`, `jido_action.ex`
*   **Change:**
    *   In `jido_action.ex`, add `@impl Jido.Action` before the generated `def run(...)`.
    *   In `jido/agent.ex`, add `@impl Jido.Agent` before the generated `def mount(...)`, `def shutdown(...)`, `def handle_signal(...)` etc.

*   **Example (inside `jido_action.ex`'s `__using__` `quote` block):**
    ```elixir
    @impl Jido.Action
    def run(params, context) do
      # ...
    end
    ```

This explicitly tells the compiler and Dialyzer that the generated function is an implementation of a behavior callback, which helps it reason about types and signatures.
