Excellent. Thank you for providing the updated code. After a thorough review of the new library structure across `jido_signal`, `jido`, and `jido_action`, the original analysis remains **highly accurate**.

The core structural issues identified previously are still present. The code has been modularized into separate libraries, which is a great step for organization, but the internal architectural patterns that pose challenges for static analysis and robustness have been carried over.

### âœ… Verification of Remaining Structural Issues

1.  **Macro-Heavy Architecture:** **Still Present**. The `use Jido.Agent` macro in `jido_lib.xml` (`jido/agent.ex`), the `use Jido.Action` macro in `jido_action_lib.xml` (`jido_action.ex`), and the `use Jido.Signal` macro in `jido_signal_lib.xml` (`jido_signal.ex`) are the primary mechanisms for generating module code. This pattern, especially in `Jido.Agent`, continues to obscure the final module structure from developers and static analysis tools.

2.  **Runtime Validation:** **Still Present**. Both `Jido.Action` and `Jido.Agent` continue to use `NimbleOptions.validate` at runtime to validate parameters and state. This is evident in the `do_validate_params` function inside the `Jido.Action` macro and the `validate/2` function in the `Jido.Agent` macro. This pushes type checks from compile-time to runtime.

3.  **Opaque State and Data Payloads:** **Still Present**.
    *   In `jido_lib.xml`, the `Jido.Agent` struct defines its `state` as a plain `map()`.
    *   In `jido_signal_lib.xml`, the `Jido.Signal` struct defines its `data` payload as `term()`.
    *   These opaque types give Dialyzer no information to work with, preventing it from catching state-related type errors.

4.  **Inconsistent Return Types:** **Still Present**.
    *   The `Jido.Agent.new/2` function generated by the macro in `jido/agent.ex` returns a bare struct `t()`.
    *   Other functions like `set/3` and `run/2` return an `OK.t()` tuple (`{:ok, _} | {:error, _}`).
    *   The `@callback` for `Jido.Action.run/2` still specifies `{:error, any()}`, which is too permissive for effective static analysis.
    *   This mix of `t()` and `{:ok, t()}` is a classic source of success typing errors in Dialyzer.

5.  **Dynamic Signal Dispatch in `jido_signal`:** **Still Present and Critical**.
    *   **Evidence:** The file `jido_signal.ex` inside `jido_signal_lib.xml` contains the most significant issue. The `__using__` macro generates a `new/2` function that explicitly uses `Process.info(self(), :current_stacktrace)` to determine the `caller` module.
    *   **Impact:** This is a runtime stack trace inspection. It is slow, opaque to static analysis, and can be unreliable. This is a primary target for improvement.

### How the Issues Apply to Each Library

Here is the breakdown of where to focus your efforts in your forked repositories.

#### 1. `jido_signal` (The Signal Definition and Dispatching Library)

*   **Primary Issue:** Dynamic Dispatch (#5). The use of `Process.info(:current_stacktrace)` in `jido_signal.ex` is the most critical flaw to address in this library. It's a performance bottleneck and a black box for static analysis.
*   **Secondary Issue:** Opaque Data (#3). The `Jido.Signal` struct's `data` field is `term()`, offering no type safety for event payloads.

#### 2. `jido_action` (The Reusable Action Definition Library)

*   **Primary Issue:** Runtime Validation (#2). The `__using__` macro in `jido_action.ex` generates runtime validation logic via `NimbleOptions`.
*   **Secondary Issue:** Inconsistent Return Types (#4). The `@callback run(...)` allows `{:error, any()}`, which is too broad for Dialyzer to be effective.

#### 3. `jido` (The Core Agent Framework)

*   **Primary Issue:** Macro Obscurity & Opaque State (#1, #3). The `use Jido.Agent` macro in `jido/agent.ex` is massive and generates a module with an opaque `state` map (`%{}`, not a typed struct). This is the biggest source of potential Dialyzer errors.
*   **Secondary Issue:** Inconsistent Return Types (#4). The generated `new/2` returns a bare struct, while `set/3`, `run/2`, etc., return `OK` tuples.

### Refined Action Plan to Harden the Framework

This plan focuses on making targeted, high-impact changes inside the macros to produce more robust, Dialyzer-friendly code.

#### Phase 1: Establish Strong, Consistent Type Contracts (High-Impact, Low Effort)

This phase will eliminate the most common success typing errors.

1.  **Standardize `Jido.Agent` Return Types:**
    *   **File:** `jido/agent.ex` (`jido_lib.xml`)
    *   **Action:** Modify the `__using__` macro.
    *   **Change `new/2`:** Find the generated `def new(...)` and wrap its return value in `OK.success()`. Add a proper typespec.
        ```elixir
        # Inside the `quote` block
        @spec new(id :: String.t() | nil, initial_state :: map() | nil) :: {:ok, t()}
        def new(id \\ nil, initial_state \\ %{}) do
          # ... (existing logic)
          agent = # ... (struct creation)
          OK.success(agent) # <--- CHANGE HERE
        end
        ```

2.  **Strengthen `Jido.Action` Callback:**
    *   **File:** `jido_action.ex` (`jido_action_lib.xml`)
    *   **Action:** Update the `@callback` for `run/2`.
    *   **Change:** Replace `{:error, any()}` with a more specific error type. `Jido.Action.Error.t()` is already defined and perfect for this.
        ```elixir
        # Current
        # @callback run(params :: map(), context :: map()) :: {:ok, map()} | {:error, any()}

        # New
        @callback run(params :: map(), context :: map()) ::
                    {:ok, map()}
                    | {:ok, map(), Jido.Instruction.t() | [Jido.Instruction.t()]} # If you support directives
                    | {:error, Jido.Action.Error.t() | atom()}
        ```

#### Phase 2: Fix Dynamic Dispatch in `jido_signal` (Critical for Robustness)

1.  **Replace Runtime Stacktrace with Compile-Time `__CALLER__`:**
    *   **File:** `jido_signal.ex` (`jido_signal_lib.xml`)
    *   **Action:** Modify the `__using__` macro.
    *   **Change:** In the generated `new/2` (or its helper), replace the `Process.info` call with the compile-time `__CALLER__` macro environment. This is a huge win for performance and static analysis.
        ```elixir
        # Inside the __using__ macro, but outside the `quote` block
        caller_module = __CALLER__.module

        # Inside the `quote` block for the generated `new` function
        # ...
        attrs = %{
          # ...
          "source" => @validated_opts[:default_source] || to_string(unquote(caller_module)), # <-- CHANGE HERE
          # ...
        }
        # ...
        ```

#### Phase 3: Make Agent State Transparent to Dialyzer (The Biggest Win for `jido`)

This is the most involved but most impactful change for the core `jido` library.

1.  **Generate a `TypedStruct` for Agent State:**
    *   **File:** `jido/agent.ex` (`jido_lib.xml`)
    *   **Action:** Modify the `__using__` macro to generate a `TypedStruct` for the state, instead of using a raw map.
    *   **Conceptual Change:**
        1.  Add `use TypedStruct` inside the `__using__` macro, before the `quote` block.
        2.  Inside the `quote` block, generate a `typedstruct` definition based on the user's `:schema` option. You will need a helper function to convert the NimbleOptions schema to `TypedStruct` fields.
        3.  Update the main `defstruct` to use this new typed state struct.

        ```elixir
        # Inside the `quote` block in `jido/agent.ex`

        # 1. Generate the state struct
        typedstruct module: State do
          # This part requires a helper function to iterate over the
          # user's schema and generate `field(:field_name, type)` calls.
          # For example, from schema: [value: [type: :integer]]
          # It should generate: field(:value, integer())
          # ...
        end

        # 2. Update the main struct definition
        defstruct @struct_keys ++ [
          # ... other fields
          state: %State{}, # <-- CHANGE HERE from %{}
          # ...
        ]

        # 3. Update the `new/2` function to initialize this struct
        def new(id \\ nil, initial_state \\ %{}) do
          # ...
          base_agent =
            struct(__MODULE__, %{
              id: generated_id,
              state: struct(State, state_defaults), # <-- CHANGE HERE
              # ...
            })
          # ...
        end
        ```

This action plan provides concrete, incremental steps to significantly improve the robustness and Dialyzer-friendliness of your forked framework while fully embracing its macro-driven design.
